```
Idea: A dashboard to track realized volatility and simple implied volatility proxies.
User goal: Decide when the market is “calm” vs. “on fire” and adjust strategies.
Core features (MVP):

* Realized volatility over different windows (1d, 7d, 30d).
* Basic “volatility regimes” (low / normal / high) by thresholds.
* ATR (Average True Range) per coin.
* Simple notification when volatility jumps above a set level.

Development plan:

1. Fetch OHLCV data via exchange API for selected pairs.
2. Implement calculations for realized volatility and ATR.
3. Build UI cards per coin with color-coded vol regime.
4. Add simple alert system (e.g., email/Telegram or in-app banner).
5. Add sorting/filtering by volatility and ATR.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

A stylized, dynamic line graph that rises and falls over a subtle globe silhouette, rendered in a bold palette of deep blue and bright orange. The background is a soft gradient from light gray to white, giving the image a clean, professional look that conveys market movement and volatility.
