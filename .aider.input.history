+Code the following app
+```
+Idea: A dashboard to track realized volatility and simple implied volatility proxies.
+User goal: Decide when the market is “calm” vs. “on fire” and adjust strategies.
+Core features (MVP):
+
+* Realized volatility over different windows (1d, 7d, 30d).
+* Basic “volatility regimes” (low / normal / high) by thresholds.
+* ATR (Average True Range) per coin.
+* Simple notification when volatility jumps above a set level.
+
+Development plan:
+
+1. Fetch OHLCV data via exchange API for selected pairs.
+2. Implement calculations for realized volatility and ATR.
+3. Build UI cards per coin with color-coded vol regime.
+4. Add simple alert system (e.g., email/Telegram or in-app banner).
+5. Add sorting/filtering by volatility and ATR.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
